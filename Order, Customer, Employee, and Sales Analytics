--For this SQL project, I analyzed a dataset called "chinook," which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, 
--invoices and customers. Using this dataset in SQLiteStudio (3.3.3), I answered multiple questions using the following written SQL queries

--Which customers are not in the US 
SELECT CustomerId, FirstName||' ' ||LastName FullName, Country
    FROM chinook.customers
    WHERE Country !='USA'
    ORDER BY CustomerId;

    FROM chinook.invoices as inv

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
